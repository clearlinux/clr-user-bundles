.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmixer\-user\-bundler [STATEDIR] [CHROOTDIR] [CONFIG] <flags>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBmixer\-user\-bundler\fP(1) is a software update generator that takes a content
root (CHROOTDIR) and CONFIG to create update metadata consumable by \fBswupd\fP(1).
.sp
\fBmixer\-user\-bundler\fP will modify chrootdir with additional content required
for \fBswupd\fP so it is recommended to make a copy of chrootdir that is used
only with \fBmixer\-user\-bundler\fP\&. The STATEDIR content needs to be maintained
between runs of \fBmixer\-user\-bundler\fP and the \fBswupd\fP update content is
located within it at STATEDIR/www/update which needs to be available to clients
to make use of this content.
.sp
The output of \fBmixer\-user\-bundler\fP is a set of manifests readable by \fBswupd\fP
as well as all the OS content \fBswupd\fP needs to perform its update operations.
The OS content includes all the files in an update as well as zero and
delta\-packs for improved update performance. The content that
\fBmixer\-user\-bundler\fP produces is tied to a specific format so that \fBswupd\fP
is guaranteed to understand it if the client is using the right version of
\fBswupd\fP\&. The way users are expected to interact with the content is through
\fBswupd\-3rd\-party\fP(1) and \fB3rd\-party\-post\fP(1) commands that setup the
content on the end users system based on the configuration provided when
creating the user bundle. See \fB3rd\-party\-post\fP(1), \fBswupd\-3rd\-party\fP(1),
\fBswupd\fP(1) and \fBos\-format\fP(7) for more details.

.INDENT 3.5
The mixer\-user\-bundler configuration file. This is a toml* formatted file
containing two tables. The first is an upstream table with url and version
keys, where url is a string that references the upstream content that
the user bundle is based on and version is an integer of the upstream
version the user bundle is to be built against. The second table is a
bundle table with name, description, includes, url and bin keys. The name
key is a string with the name of the user bundle being created, the
description key is a short string describing what the bundle\(aqs purpose is
for an end user, the includes key is an array of strings that are names
of upstream bundles that are to be installed in order for the user bundle
to function, the url key is a string which has the update url for the user
bundle content (pointing to the STATEDIR/www/update content) and the bin
key is an array of strings with absolute paths that resolve to executables
in the CHROOTDIR that are to be exposed as executables to the end user.
